# Evolve

A really old piece of code, that's supposed to be an evolution tracking/simulator, idk?

It's supposed to simulate a 2D "earth" or environment. Which has water and earth, and following a set of rules, the sun moves draws up water and rains or snows, the earth turns to mud, water to ice, etc.

It should/would have been an evolution simultor if I ever finished it. The goal was to create a world, and see if the conditions that were generated would produce "life", or a simple base organism (which would be introduced), that would in turn evolve, "randomly" based on what traits it changes, that proved most successful in the environment.

Hope to one day come back to this and maybe make some entertaining progress :-)
